# Pothole Detection System

Potholes are one of the main problems while driving on Indian roads and cause a lot of fatalities every year. The Pothole Detection System aims at helping authorities improve road conditions and fix potholes efficiently by knowing which ones to fix and their locations. The system is designed to detect potholes when a vehicle drives through it by recording the footage of the road when it slows down. Using a CNN model, the video is analyzed and searched for potholes. If a pothole is detected, the severity of the pothole and its location is stored onto the cloud database. This database with the information on the severity of each pothole will help the authorities to generate a list of potholes ranking from the ones where the vehicle needs to slow down a lot to get around the pothole, to the ones where the vehicle can around the pothole without slowing down much. This will ultimately help authorities to determine which ones cause more traffic problems and fix them with priority.
